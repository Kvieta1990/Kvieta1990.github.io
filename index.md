Working as neutron scattering scientist at ORNL, I have been 
actively involved in software development and scientific research activities.
The software development part mainly involves the development and maintenance of
tools for neutron scattering data reduction and analysis, such as ADDIE environment
for neutron total scattering data reduction, ADDIE web interface for structure
mining and online Bragg and pair distribution function refinement, RMCProfile package
for fitting scattering data based on supercell approach. Meanwhile, I am also
interfacing the beamline scientists team and the software development team at ORNL,
actively working on the development of Mantid framework for powder diffraction data reduction.

My research interest mainly focuses on the application of neutron total scattering
to look at local structure of materials - both nucleus and magnetic. The local environment
plays an important role in determining properties in a wide range of functional materials,
e.g., the polarization behavior in ferroelectric materials, ion transportation behavior in
energy story materials, magnetic anisotropy in low dimensional magnetic systems, etc. My
research interest at this point is to utilize total scattering technique to reveal local
structure for energy storage (e.g. Li-ion battery, functional material (high entropy spinel
materials) and low dimensional magnetic system (e.g. 2D vdWs magnetic materials). For
futuristic perspective, using machine learning algorithms in phase recognition during
phase transition is one of the goals to pursue.

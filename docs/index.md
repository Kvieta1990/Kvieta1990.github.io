<br />

<p style='text-align: justify;'>This version of RMC was built from the original
RMCA code of McGreevy & Pusztai to determine the local structure of crystalline
materials while still being capable of analyzing disordered systems. The 
current version of RMCProfile results from a collaboration between scientists
at ISIS facility (UK), Spallation Neutron Source (SNS at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory, US), University of Cambridge (UK), University of Oxford (UK),
Queen Mary University of London (QMUL, UK) and National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST, US). It is now possible to fit many data types 
simultaneously (Neutron & X-ray total scattering & the Bragg profile, EXAFS,
single crystal diffuse scattering) and use a range of constraints to produce
atomic models that are consistent with all the available data. In this way we
are progressing the effort to develop a 'complex modeling' approach to 
elucidate structural details of materials that are the key to their
exploitable functional properties.

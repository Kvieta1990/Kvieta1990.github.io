**This repository is for hosting the RMCProfile website only. Currently, we are not considering making RMCProfile fully open source and therefore the package source code is not attached here.**

**When hopping to the release page, the source code package provided there contains only current repository - the RMCProfile website itself. For those interested in building up their own website using GitHub pages, they can either download the source code from there or fork current repository to use our set-up as a template.**

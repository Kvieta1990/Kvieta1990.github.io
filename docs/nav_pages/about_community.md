**Two magic ways to join the RMCProfile community for discussion**

---

- [`Recommended`] GitHub Issues.

    - Go to `COMMUNITY` -> `ON GITHUB` in the top-right corner of the page.

    - Quickly access community discussion,

        - Once opening the `ON GITHUB` link, bookmark it.

        - The GitHub issues are associated with a GitHub repository. Therefore,
          `Star` the repository will give you quick access to our GitHub issues
          through your `Starred` repository.

        - Access to the community through this RMCProfile website is not a bad
          option.

    - More information to be presented below.

- Mailing list.

    - Go to `COMMUNITY` -> `MAILING LIST` in the top-right corner of the page.

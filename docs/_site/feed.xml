        <title>About Coriolis force</title>
        <description>
          
          
First, a comprehensive GIF animation demonstrating the basic ideas of Coriolis force is presented.












Detailed explanation and derivation is presented in the following embedded document.

        <title>Notes on magnetism - III</title>
        <description>
          Various physical quantities describing magnetic field - 
          Talking about magnetic field, we have three relevant physical quantities - magnetic field \(\vec{H}\), magnetic induction field \(\vec{B}\) and magnetization field \(\vec{M}\). It is straightforward to understand \(\vec{M}\) - when applying magnetic field (here, by â€˜magnetic fieldâ€™, we mean something in general, but not specifically refer to \(\vec{H}\)), we use...

          Magnetic ions in crystals - 
          Talking about the magnetism of ions in crystals naturally brings us out of the atomic physics picture which we previously based ourselves in when discussing the free atom and ions (see previous note by clicking me!). Also, for sure we should turn to the many-electron scheme instead of a single-electron...

          Magnetism of free atoms and ions - 
          To understand the magnetism of free atoms and ions, we may go through several stages, as follows, Hartree approximation - electrons are treated in a non-interactive manner. Beyond Hartree - interaction between electrons is taken into account. Spin-orbital coupling. Hyperfine interaction - the interaction between electrons and nucleus. Stage-1 At...

        <description>
          
          Ernst Ising (Left) and Wilhelm Lenz (Right) - Ising was Lenzâ€™s student and the Ising model was claimed (by Ising himself) to be originated by Lenz but named after Ising. Ising model was originally proposed for ferromagnetism and owing to its simplicity in describing the system interaction, it has been...

        <title>Derivation of neutron incoherent scattering length</title>
        <description>
          
          Figure. 1. Neutron scattering length table by NIST [1]. When we do calculations relevant to neutron scattering, it is unavoidable that we will come across either coherent, incoherent or total scattering length of elements, which describes the strength of scattering neutrons by different elements, either coherently, incoherently or both. In...

          Implementation of nano-size effect correction for modeling PDF - 
          Figure. 1. Simulation box for bulk (left) and nano (right) systems. In Ref. [1], we discussed the theoretical principles for correcting the nano-size effect when modeling the pair distribution function (PDF). The fundamental idea is to bring back the uncorrelated pairings in between atoms belong to different nanoparticles, based on...

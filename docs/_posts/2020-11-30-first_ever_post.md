<p style='text-align: justify'>Taking advantage of the power provided by GitHub pages,
we managed to set up a modern-look website for RMCProfile package. Users can follow up
with our updates of RMCProfile package, download historical releases of the package,
learn about how to use RMCProfile and join the community for discussions and proposing 
questions, etc.</p>

<br />

<p style='text-align: justify'>Please let us know if you have any concerns/ideas
about our new website, either by leaving comments below or popping at our
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Kvieta1990/kvieta1990.github.io/issues">community</a> to
propose your thoughts.</p>

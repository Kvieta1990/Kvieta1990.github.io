In this post, I will be covering the application packaging on MacOS. It involves multiple stage of efforts, concerning the library path configuration, application folder packaging, release package preparation, and application notarization & signature. Here I am taking our `RMCProfile` package (a package for neutron total scattering data analysis, see [here](https://rmcprofile.ornl.gov) for details) as an example. Specific steps may not be generally applicable, but I hope the post can at least provide some hints about what to worry about. In fact, the most tricky part, namely the final stage of package notarization and signature, is indeed generally applicable.

First, our `RMCProfile` package is written in Fortran and we were using `gfortran` compiler to compile the codes to executable. The executable does require some libraries which we intend to include in the release package so they can be used directly by the executable without the effort from users to install those libraries. Here comes the first part we need to worry about while packaging up our executable and libraries. The libraries we need to incorporate into the release package might be installed into some local location on our compiling machine, such as `/usr/lib`, or whatever. Finding those libraries should not be a big problem. However, in many cases, those libraries may have further dependencies and we need to find and package up those further dependencies as well, which, again, is not a big problem. The problem is, library files on MacOS hard code the path of their dependency libraries. So, if we ship the libraries as is, on the user side, when they execute our executable, the shipped libraries will try to find their further dependencies following the initial hard coded path. But the user computer may not have those further dependencies in those initially hard coded locations. So, not only we need to package up all the dependencies, but also we need to change the hard coded dependency path to point to where our shipped libraries will be located on users' machines. Now we are facing another problem, if our package can be placed anywhere on users' machines, changing those hard coded paths will have to be done on users' side. Fortunately, MacOS usually puts application under the `/Applications` directory -- it is probably not enforced (I am not sure actually) but in most cases, it is at least a very commonly followed convention. This brings us the convenience of changing those hard coded paths on the developer side. To do that, we have to know what those hard coded library paths are, which can be done using the `otool` tool, by running something like `otool -L libgfortran.5.dylib`. Then we can use `install_name_tool` to change the hard coded path to where we intend to put our shipped libraries. The command will be something like,

```bash
install_name_tool -change /usr/local/opt/gcc@12/lib/gcc/12/libgcc_s.1.1.dylib /Applications/RMCProfile.app/Contents/MacOS/libs/libgcc_s.1.1.dylib libgfortran.5.dylib
```

where the first path after `-change` is the initial hard coded path, the second part is the new path we want to change it to. In this case, our package will be located at `/Applications/RMCProfile.app` and the shipped library file can therefore be located and used here. The final input is just the library file we want to operate on. One thing we should notice is that Apple may change those initial hard coded paths from time to time while they are upgrading the operating system, in which case we have no choice but to follow up to repeat the procedure here.

Next, we are going to prepare the `RMCProfile.app` directory -- on MacOS, when we say an `app`, it usually refers to a directory with the name like `APP_NAME.app`. Yes, the app is nothing but a directory -- we can right click on an app and click `Show Package Contents` to go into the app directory to view the contents inside. Here, I am taking our `RMCProfile` package as an example. The package can be downloaded [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rmcprofile/files/Version_6.7.9/RMCProfile_V6.7.9_Mac_Intel.dmg/download) for reference. The directory organization is as below,

```
RMCProfile.app
   - Contents
      - MacOS
         - RMCProfile
         - exe
         - libs
         - RMCProfile_setup.command
         - tutorial
      - Resources
         - iconfile.icns
      - Info.plist
```

Here, 'RMCProfile' in the 'MacOS' subfolder should be exactly the stem name of our app (in our case, it is 'RMCProfile'). It is actually an executable script. Once our app is installed into the '/Applications' folder, launching our app actually execute just the 'RMCProfile' script here. The script is an AppleScript that further launches a terminal and run the `RMCProfile_setup.command` script to launch our `RMCProfile` main program. This is our specific steps of program launching as a chain and for sure in practice, one could have very flexible to come up whatever chain of executions while launching the app.

> DON'T forget to make the `RMCProfile` script EXECUTABLE!!!

The 'iconfile.icns' under 'Resources' folder is our icon file. The file name is arbitrary, and it has to be specified in the `Info.plist` file. Here, I am showing a simplified version of the `Info.plist` file, specifying nothing but the icon file,

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
      <key>CFBundleIconFile</key>
      <string>iconfile</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Before moving on, one tiny step to take -- create a soft link to the `/Applications` directory and put it somewhere -- we will use this later when preparing the release package. Now, our app file is ready and next, we are going to prepare the release package. One may wonder that, since the app file is in fact just a directory and we have already got the directory ready, can we just give users the app (e.g., the `RMCProfile.app` in my case), they put it under their `/Applications` directory and everything should be working, right? In the old days, this is probably fine. In fact, in the old days, we don't even need to prepare the app in the `RMCProfile.app` structure as shown above -- we can just put our program folder under `/Applications` and launch our program (e.g., execute the `RMCProfile_setup.command` script from the terminal) without any problems. However, this is already not possible on the new MacOS systems. I cannot remember from which version of the MacOS did we start to have such strict constraints by Apple -- the shipped libraries and executables have to be signed and notarized (basically, submitted to Apple and they will check the program for malicious stuff). But anyhow, for most running MacOS these days, such strict constraints exist. If we still use the old way of shipping apps, either they cannot be executed on the user side, or, users have to click `OK` to confirm for every library included in the package, every time they launch our program. This just becomes unrealistic. So, there are several things for us package developers to do,

- First, we need to become an Apple developer (at [developer.apple.com/](https://developer.apple.com/)), which costs ~$100 per year -- yes, we develop packages for Apple and we need to pay for doing that. This is Apple. Well, Apple probably does not think so -- you guys are not developing for us; instead, we are providing the platform for you to develop, so it shouldn't be free. Well, anyways, Apple, you win -- I am not going to argue with you since I know, there is no way I can win this argue, and I have to follow your way, anyhow.

- Once we pay and become an Apple developer, we can log in [developer.apple.com/](https://developer.apple.com/) and we will see the following,

<p align='center'>

   style="border:none;"
   width="800"
   alt="apple_developer_enter"
   title="apple_developer_enter" />
</p>

- Next, we want to create a certificate and download it to our local development machine -- to do this, click on the `Certificates` link shown above. Then, we want to click on the `+` sign in the presented page to create a certificate,

<p align='center'>
<img src="/assets/img/posts/apple_dev_cert_create.png"
   style="border:none;"
   width="500"
   alt="apple_dev_cert_create"
   title="apple_dev_cert_create" />
</p>

- Then we will be prompted the interface to select `Software` to develop and in this case we want to select `Mac App Distribution`,

   > We don't have to select anything for the `Services` in the page, but we have to check to agree the agreement down at the bottom of the page.

<p align='center'>

   style="border:none;"
   width="800"
   alt="apple_dev_select"
   title="apple_dev_select" />
</p>

- Next, we will be prompted the interface to upload a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file,

<p align='center'>
<img src="/assets/img/posts/apple_dev_csr.png"
   style="border:none;"
   width="800"
   alt="apple_dev_csr"
   title="apple_dev_csr" />
</p>

- The steps [here](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/certificates/create-a-certificate-signing-request) can be followed to generate the CSR file on our local development machine. Then we can upload the file on the interface above to finish up the certificate creation.

- Once the certifcate is successfully created, we should be able to see it in the `Certificates` interface as presented above (the image following the 3rd step above). Clicking on the certificate, we can then download the certificate to our local dev machine.

- We can then double click on the downloaded certificate to import it to our `keychain`. When the `Manage Your Passwords in the New Passwords App` pops up, just click on the `Open Keychain Access` button,

<p align='center'>
<img src="/assets/img/posts/apple_keychain.png"
   style="border:none;"
   width="300"
   alt="apple_keychain"
   title="apple_keychain" />
</p>

- The certificate is now in our keychain and we should be ready to move next, regarding the executable and libraries signature and the final notarization. Apple does provide tools to do both, but I found it is a bit tedious to follow. Here, I am using a tool called `DMG Canvas` which can do all the following steps regarding the packaging (to a `DMG` file, thus named) and notarization. It is not free, either, but it does help a lot in saving efforts. This is the main interface of the program,

<p align='center'>
<img src="/assets/img/posts/dmg_canvas_enter.png"
   style="border:none;"
   width="800"
   alt="dmg_canvas_enter"
   title="dmg_canvas_enter" />
</p>

- Here we need to add in our prepared `RMCProfile.app` file and if we want, we can add in a background image to make it more beautiful. Also, we can add in the soft link created for the `/Applications` directory as mentioned earlier as well. All of these adding-in can be done via the `+` button (top-left in the image shown above).

- Clicking on the app `RMCProfile` under the `Disk Image` (in the left panel in the image above), we should see the interface like below,

<p align='center'>
<img src="/assets/img/posts/dmg_config.png"
   style="border:none;"
   width="800"
   alt="dmg_config"
   title="dmg_config" />
</p>

- We can choose an icon for the `DMG` file to be created. The critical step, though, is to select the `Gatekeeper` -- `Code Sign and Notarize` is working for me -- though, I found still I need to sign those executables and libraries included in my package manually, as I will mention next. If we successfully imported the certificate into our keychain, we should now be able to see the relevant selection from the `Signing Cert` and `Apple ID` dropdown list and we just need to select it (actualy, both are associated with the Apple developer ID).

- Once all the preparation work is done, in principle, we should be able to finalize the packaging, signature and notarization steps all-at-once by clicking on the little hammer icon as shown in the first `DMG` interface image above. However, in my case, I found that the `DMG Canvas` canot sign all the libraries that I include in my packages -- maybe it is because of my specific way of including those libraries. But anyhow, I just have to sign all the executables and libraries manually before I hit the hammer button to finalize. To do the manual signing, we want to run something like,

   ```
   codesign --force --verbose --options runtime --sign 'Developer ID Application: Yuanpeng Zhang (7C4Q5HWAF8)' my_lib_or_exe_file_to_sign
   ```

   > If the `codesign` command is not available, we need to install `XCode` and the `XCode` command line tools. `XCode` can be installed in the Apple store, if it is not already installed initially. To install the `XCode` command line tools, we need to run `xcode-select --install` from the terminal.

   > `Developer ID Application: Yuanpeng Zhang (7C4Q5HWAF8)` here is referring to the certificate that we previously imported into our keychain and again it is associated with our Apple developer ID. We can see it in the `Keychain` application, if we go to `System` and check out the name among all the imported certificates. If we see `3rd Party Mac ...` in front of the certicate name, we need to exclude that from the certificate name put into the command above, namely the certicate that we put above should start with `Developer...`.

- We just need to run the command above on all our executables and libraries included in the `RMCProfile.app`, using, e.g., a bash script. As we said earlier, the `RMCProfile.app` is in fact a directory, so we can `cd` into it from the terminal.

- After the manual signing, in my case, I have to run the following command from the terminal,

   ```bash
   xattr -r RMCProfile.app
   ```

   > If we don't do that on our side, when users download our package and try to open the app, Apple will complain about the app is damaged or something, in which cases users then need to run the command above on their side to solve the issue. If we do it here, they don't need to do it.

- Finally, we go back to `DMG Canvas` and click on the hammer button to run through the `DMG` file building and the `DMG Canvas` will upload the packaged `DMG` file to Apple for notarization. At this stage, we don't need to do anything manually, but just waiting for its finishing.

- Now, it is the `DMG` file we packaged, signed and notarized that we want to ship to users. On their side, they just double click on the downloaded DMG file and install our app just like the installation of a typical MacOS app by drag-and-drop.

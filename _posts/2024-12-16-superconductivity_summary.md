The diagram below is maded out of the nice article in Ref. [1] by Prof. C. Slichter, summarizing the history of the early development of superconductivity. It goes over the discovery of superconducting phenomenon, the early efforts in revealing the reason why such a peculiar phenomenon could ever happen, the building up of those recipes for finally revealing the microscopic origin of the superconductivity at the fundamental level, until the proposition of the BCS theory of superconductivity, by J. Bardeen, L. Cooper and B. Schrieffer.

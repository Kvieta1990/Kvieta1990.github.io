When neutrons interact with a measured sample, scattering is one type of the interaction, while absorption is another type. However, for a scattering measurement, the absorption effect 'steals' part of the intensity that should belong to the scattering intensity. Therefore, without the correction for the absorption effect, the measured intensity is not a clean representation of the scattering interaction. To correct for the absorption effect, one has various methods -- refer to the documentation in Ref. [1] for details. Here in this post, I will be talking about the numerical integration approach for the absorption effect correction. I will skip the theoretical part as it has been talked about in Ref. [1] and references therein. Instead, I will specifically focus on the technical part concerning the definition of sample and container geometry, which is critical for performing the numerical integration.

In this post, some basics about the stray and demagnetization field will be covered. The post originates from reading the book by St√∂hr -- Ref. [1].

To get an idea about the stray and demagnetization field, one needs to go back to the Stoke's theorem,
</p>

$$
\oint \vec{H} \cdot d\vec{l} = \iint_S (\nabla \times \vec{H})_n dS
$$

<p style='text-align: justify'>
The integrand on the right hand side is the current density, according to,
</p>

$$
\nabla \times \vec{H} = \vec{j}
$$

<p style='text-align: justify'>
In the case of no current flow, we have $$\vec{j} = 0$$ and therefore we should accordingly have the left hand side being 0 as well. There then comes the requirement that we have the magnetic field inside and outside of the material being opposite to each other -- inside the material, we have the `demagnetization field` (since it is opposite to the external magnetic field and therefore is trying to cancel it out) and outside the material, we have the `stray field`.
</p>

<br />

<p style='text-align: justify'>
To get an idea about the relation between magnetization field inside the material and the magnetic field, one then needs to turn to the Gauss's theorem,
</p>

$$
\iint_S \vec{B} \cdot \vec{n} dS = \iiint_V \nabla \cdot \vec{B} dV
$$

<p style='text-align: justify'>
Since we don't have magnetic monopole, we should have the left hand side of the equation being 0, which then indicates $$\nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0$$.

Combined with the relation between magnetic induction field, magnetic field and magnetization field,
</p>

$$
\vec{B} = \mu_0\vec{H} + \vec{M}
$$

<p style='text-align: justify'>
we then have,
</p>

$$
\mu_0\nabla \cdot \vec{H} = -\nabla \cdot \vec{M}
$$

<p style='text-align: justify'>
Mathematically, it is just a matter of reorganization of expression. However, physically, it infers a clear picture as presented in Fig. 2 -- outside the material, it is just the stray field and inside the material, the end result of the interaction between the magnetic induction ($$\vec{B}$$) and the demagnetization ($$\vec{H}_d$$) field is the magnetization field ($$\vec{M}$$). Furthermore, we can imagine positive and negative magnetic 'charge' on the surface of the material, just like what we would have for electric field -- though, in practice, we know that the magnetic 'charge' does not even exist. According to the equation above, we can say that the 'positive charge' on the right hand side of Fig. 2 is the source of the external stray field and is the sink of the internal magnetization field, and vice versa for the 'negative charge' on the left hand side.

<br />

**N. B.** In the equation above, when we say $$\vec{H}$$, we mean both $$\vec{H}_d$$ inside the material and $$\vec{H}_s$$ outside the material.

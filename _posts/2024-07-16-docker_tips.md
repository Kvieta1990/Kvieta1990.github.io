# üè∑Ô∏è Use `git diff` in a Docker container

Within a Docker container, if we are located in a `git` repository and try to execute `git diff`, there will be no problems. However, if the current working directory is not a `git` repository and we try to execute `git diff /full/path/to/git/repo`, the command will fail, complaining about `not a working repository`. This is something relevant to the environment and configuration within the Docker container. To solve this issue, we can set up the `GIT_DIR` environment variable first, change to the `git` repository directory, and then execute `git diff` [1],

```bash
export GIT_DIR=/full/path/to/git/repo/.git
cd /full/path/to/git/repo
git diff
```

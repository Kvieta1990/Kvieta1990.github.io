This is my personal blog, created to share information about myself and document my learning journey. For every idea that I believe is crucial for understanding specific physics or other topics, I strive to write them down. This practice helps me refresh my mind periodically. Additionally, if someone with a passion for physics, coding, etc. happens to visit this site, I hope these materials can assist them, or they can offer valuable advice to help me refine my understanding.

We all have moments when we forget something we once understood. So why not write it down when we are sure you have grasped it (though someday, what we were sure about might turn out to be wrong!)? Learning physics, or anything else, is a process of accumulation, and we can never be certain about what is important or not. Nor can we say with complete confidence that we truly understand the real meaning of specific issues – this reminds me of R. Feynman's saying about the ‘illusion of understanding’. So, let's write everything down and review it in the future or share it with others. Two outcomes are possible: one is, 'Ah ha, what I thought at that time is absolutely correct!' which reinforces our understanding. The other is, 'Oh no, what I wrote back then is totally wrong!' This is not a disaster, as realizing something is wrong is better than pretending everything is right.

At last, it is reading, writing, reviewing and effective interaction that makes everybody and also physics itself different from what it was yesterday. So, let's write!

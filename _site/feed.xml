        <description>
          About stray and demagnetization field - 
          In this post, some basics about the stray and demagnetization field will be covered. The post originates from reading the book by StÃ¶hr â€“ Ref. [1]. Figure. 1. Demonstration of materials magnetization â€“ reproduced from Fig. 2.6 in Ref. [1]. To get an idea about the stray and demagnetization field,...

        <description>
          Various physical quantities describing magnetic field - 
          Talking about magnetic field, we have three relevant physical quantities - magnetic field \(\vec{H}\), magnetic induction field \(\vec{B}\) and magnetization field \(\vec{M}\). It is straightforward to understand \(\vec{M}\) - when applying magnetic field (here, by â€˜magnetic fieldâ€™, we mean something in general, but not specifically refer to \(\vec{H}\)), we use...

          Illustration for Stern-Glach experiment [1]. Angular moment means rotation - this applies to electron as well. For electrons, any movement is associated with current and therefore angular moment naturally is tightly linked to current as well. Furthermore, current means magnetic field, as originated by Orsted. Mathematically, starting from expressing the...

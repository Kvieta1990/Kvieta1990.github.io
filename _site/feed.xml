        <title>Output of the Reduced Time-of-Flight Powder Diffraction Bragg Data</title>
        <description>
          
          Fundamentally, the Bragg diffraction data that we will be using for the Rietveld analysis is nothing different as compared to the total scattering data ‚Äì it is just that for the Bragg data analysis, we focus only on the Bragg peaks, treating the diffuse scattering signal as purely the background....

        <title>Van Hove Function</title>
        <description>
          
          The Van Hove function describes the time dependent pair correlation between atoms, \[G(r, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \rho_0Nr^2}\sum_{i,j}\delta(r - |\vec{r}_i(0) - \vec{r}_j(t)|)\] \(i\) and \(j\) runs over all the \(N\) atoms in the system. \(\vec{r}_i\) refers to the position of the atom \(i\) at time \(t\). The following formula describes the...

        <description>
          
          Close packing means that if assuming hard sphere model for atoms, we would have as much dense packing of those hard spheres as possible. Specifically, this refers to the packing of equal spheres (radius being equal). Normally, we have two types of close packing, the hexagonal close packing (HCP) and...

          Normally for a powder sample, we are assuming that we have a uniform distribution of orientation of those small crystalline samples, meaning that we have many small crystalline pieces of the sample and their orientation in space is uniform. As such, in the measured powder diffraction pattern, the peak intensities...

          In crystallography, quite often we would use the 6 lattice parameters to describe the unit cell, namely, a, b, c, \(\alpha\), \(\beta\) and \(\gamma\). In some cases, we would also need to construct those lattice vectors (\(\vec{a}\), \(\vec{b}\) and \(\vec{c}\)) in Cartesian coordinate system. For example, when we want to...

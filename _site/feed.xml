        <title>Sample and Container geometry for absorption correction</title>
        <description>
          
          When neutrons interact with a measured sample, scattering is one type of the interaction, while absorption is another type. However, for a scattering measurement, the absorption effect ‘steals’ part of the intensity that should belong to the scattering intensity. Therefore, without the correction for the absorption effect, the measured intensity...

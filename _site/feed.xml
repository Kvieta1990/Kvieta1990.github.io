        <title>Preferred Orientation and Texture</title>
        <description>
          
          Normally for a powder sample, we are assuming that we have a uniform distribution of orientation of those small crystalline samples, meaning that we have many small crystalline pieces of the sample and their orientation in space is uniform. As such, in the measured powder diffraction pattern, the peak intensities...

        <title>Dirac Equation</title>
        <description>
          
          Introduction Here in this post, I will be summarizing the derivation of Dirac Equation, following the YouTube video series in Ref. [1-3]. Dirac equation, at the same time beautifully combining quantum mechanics (QM) and special relativity (SR), also infers the existence of electron spin, proposes the existence of antimatter, and...

        <title>Construct lattice vectors from lattice parameters</title>
        <description>
          
          In crystallography, quite often we would use the 6 lattice parameters to describe the unit cell, namely, a, b, c, \(\alpha\), \(\beta\) and \(\gamma\). In some cases, we would also need to construct those lattice vectors (\(\vec{a}\), \(\vec{b}\) and \(\vec{c}\)) in Cartesian coordinate system. For example, when we want to...

          To set up services on VPS, one could follow the conventional routine to configure the server and set up the services. However, such services would then live natively on the VPS operating system, which is not completely self-contained (e.g., one may need to configure multiple services in the same configuration...

          In the reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) modeling, there is no constraint of symmetry exerted on the model. Once the initial unit cell is expanded to a supercell, the symmetry constraint will be removed and the model will be purely driven by the data together with some other physical or chemical...

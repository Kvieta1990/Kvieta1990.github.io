        <title>Set up our own search engine with Yacy</title>
        <description>
          
          The fundamental idea of web searching is through web crawling, critical information about the website and the embedded links in the crawled website can be obtained. Based on the crawling results, a ranking algorithm could be applied, based on which one can search the website using keywords. Nowadays, we get...

        <title>Resize Oracle VPS volume</title>
        <description>
          
          When setting up Oracle cloud instance, we would give the instance an initial allocation of volume, and later on we might find that the initial volume size is not enough as we install more and more services into our VPS. In such a situation, we may want to expand the...

        <description>
          
          Dify is an LLM application platform which can provide access to various LLM models, tools and applications. With it, we can build our own ChatBot server acting just like ChatGPT. At the backend, it utilizes the LLM services from various providers, such as openAI, Gemini, etc., through API call. In...

          Initial Docker Image Build As conventionally, the ADDIE (ADvanced DIffraction Environment, available at addie.ornl.gov) service is deployed on a VPS (specifically, an instance on the ORNL hosted research cloud). The service itself and all the necessary configurations are therefore locked to the VPS machine, making it extremely painful for transfer...

        <title>Setting up services on VPS using docker</title>
        <description>
          
          To set up services on VPS, one could follow the conventional routine to configure the server and set up the services. However, such services would then live natively on the VPS operating system, which is not completely self-contained (e.g., one may need to configure multiple services in the same configuration...

        <title>Find out symmetry from RMC fitted supercell</title>
        <description>
          
          In the reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) modeling, there is no constraint of symmetry exerted on the model. Once the initial unit cell is expanded to a supercell, the symmetry constraint will be removed and the model will be purely driven by the data together with some other physical or chemical...

The fundamental idea is that when the phase difference is the integer multiple of the wavelength,...

For cross-platform usage, for sure, Teamviewer is probably...

          Reversing the transformation from reciprocal space to real space given an experimentally measured diffraction pattern is difficult in practice since the phase information is lost in the experimental diffraction measurement and we are left with only the intensities of the Bragg spots. The Fourier map approach is one of commonly...

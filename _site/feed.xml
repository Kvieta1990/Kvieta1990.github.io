        <title>Development environment setup for RMCProfile on Windows</title>
        <description>
          
          This blog is for noting down the details about setting up the development environment for RMCProfile on Windows machine. The notes here are still based on the conventional way of compiling using make files. There is some work happening in the background now to transfer the compiling to using cmake....

        <title>Description of Magnetic Structure with Propogation Vector</title>
        <description>
          
          The magnetic structure sits on top of the nucleus structure and in general, the periodicity of the magnetic structure can be different from that of the nucleus structure. However, the periodicity of the two is indeed related and usually we treat the magnetic structure as a modulation of the nucleus...

        <description>
          
          The diagram below is maded out of the nice article in Ref. [1] by Prof. C. Slichter, summarizing the history of the early development of superconductivity. It goes over the discovery of superconducting phenomenon, the early efforts in revealing the reason why such a peculiar phenomenon could ever happen, the...

        <title>Set up workflows for bidirectional connection between NocoDB and Slack</title>
        <description>
          
          NocoDB is a web-based platform that allows building no-code database, with a spreadsheet-like interface, allowing convenient interaction with the database. Here in this post, I am going to walk through the setup of workflows that connects the NocoDB database with Slack, in a bidirectional manner. Namely, we can build a...

          Fundamentally, the Bragg diffraction data that we will be using for the Rietveld analysis is nothing different as compared to the total scattering data ‚Äì it is just that for the Bragg data analysis, we focus only on the Bragg peaks, treating the diffuse scattering signal as purely the background....

        <title>Van Hove Function</title>
        <description>
          
          The Van Hove function describes the time dependent pair correlation between atoms, \[G(r, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \rho_0Nr^2}\sum_{i,j}\delta(r - |\vec{r}_i(0) - \vec{r}_j(t)|)\] \(i\) and \(j\) runs over all the \(N\) atoms in the system. \(\vec{r}_i\) refers to the position of the atom \(i\) at time \(t\). The following formula describes the...

        <description>
          
          Close packing means that if assuming hard sphere model for atoms, we would have as much dense packing of those hard spheres as possible. Specifically, this refers to the packing of equal spheres (radius being equal). Normally, we have two types of close packing, the hexagonal close packing (HCP) and...

          Normally for a powder sample, we are assuming that we have a uniform distribution of orientation of those small crystalline samples, meaning that we have many small crystalline pieces of the sample and their orientation in space is uniform. As such, in the measured powder diffraction pattern, the peak intensities...

          In crystallography, quite often we would use the 6 lattice parameters to describe the unit cell, namely, a, b, c, \(\alpha\), \(\beta\) and \(\gamma\). In some cases, we would also need to construct those lattice vectors (\(\vec{a}\), \(\vec{b}\) and \(\vec{c}\)) in Cartesian coordinate system. For example, when we want to...
